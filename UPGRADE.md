# Upgrade Guide

## Prerequisites

Before migrating to this fork, ensure:
- Your application is running on PHP 7.4
- You're using CakePHP 2.10.24 (earlier versions are not supported)
- Your application uses Composer for dependency management

## From Original CakePHP 2.x

1. **Update to CakePHP 2.10.24 first**: If you're using an earlier version, update to `cakephp/cakephp:2.10.24` on PHP 7.4 first
2. **Ensure PHP 7.4 Compatibility**: Your application must be fully working on PHP 7.4 before migrating to PHP 8.x
3. **Update Composer**: Replace `cakephp/cakephp` with `pieceofcake2/cakephp` in your `composer.json`
4. **Upgrade PHP**: Update your PHP version to 8.0 or newer
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Run your application's test suite to ensure compatibility

## Breaking Changes

### Post-Installation Steps

#### For Legacy Directory Structure (`app/` directory)

After installation, install the Bake plugin and copy dispatcher files:

```bash
# Install Bake plugin
composer require --dev pieceofcake2/bake

# Copy web dispatcher files
cp plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/webroot/index.php app/webroot/index.php
cp plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/webroot/test.php app/webroot/test.php

# Copy console dispatcher
cp plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/Console/cake app/Console/cake
chmod +x app/Console/cake
```

#### For Modern Directory Structure (`src/` directory)

The following files need to be updated:
- `config/define.php`
- `bin/cake`
- `webroot/index.php`
- `webroot/test.php`

See [`pieceofcake2/app`](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/app) for the modern application skeleton compatible with both CakePHP 2.x and 5.x.

### Directory Structure Modernization ([PR #21](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/21))

- **Directory layout has been restructured to modern standards**
- `lib/Cake/` → `src/Cake/` (framework source code)
- `lib/Cake/Test/Case/` → `tests/TestCase/` (framework tests)
- `lib/Cake/Test/Fixture/` → `tests/Fixture/` (test fixtures)
- `lib/Cake/Console/cake` → `bin/cake` (console executable)
- `lib/Cake/Config/` → `config/` (framework configuration files at root level)
- `lib/Cake/View/` and `lib/Cake/Templates/` → `templates/` (framework default templates at root level)
- All configuration files and paths updated accordingly
- Added `CORE_ROOT` constant to reference framework root directory

**Modern Test Directory Support:**
- Applications and plugins can now use modern `tests/TestCase/` and `tests/Fixture/` directory structure
- Test suite automatically detects both `Test/Case/` (traditional) and `tests/TestCase/` (modern) directories
- Fixture loader supports both `Test/Fixture/` and `tests/Fixture/` locations
- Enables gradual migration to modern directory structure for application tests
- No breaking changes - both directory structures work simultaneously

**Migration:**
- No action required for applications using this framework as a dependency
- `bin/cake` (or `vendor/bin/cake` when installed via Composer) now intelligently detects your project structure
- Automatically works with both modern `src/` and traditional `app/` directory layouts
- Optionally migrate your application tests from `app/Test/Case/` to `app/tests/TestCase/` at your own pace

**Enhanced Console Executable:**
- `bin/cake` now automatically detects project root from Composer's autoloader
- No manual configuration needed - works out of the box with any project structure
- Supports modern (`src/`) and traditional (`app/`) application directories

### Composer Autoloading Migration

The framework has migrated from include-path to Composer classmap autoloading. This change simplifies class loading and improves compatibility with modern PHP tooling.

**What changed:**
- Removed `App::uses()` declarations from CakePHP framework classes (798 occurrences removed)
- CakePHP framework classes are now automatically loaded via Composer's classmap autoloader
- Application classes can be automatically loaded by configuring Composer classmap autoloading (see Migration section below)
- CakePHP framework classes that extend application classes use `App::uses()`:
  - `App::uses('AppController', 'Controller')` - for CakeErrorController
  - `App::uses('AppModel', 'Model')` - for I18nModel, AcoAction, Permission
  - `App::uses('AppShell', 'Console/Command')` - for all core shell commands
  - `App::uses('AppHelper', 'View/Helper')` - for all core helpers

**Migration:**

**For new projects or modern directory structure (`src/`):**
- Recommended: Update your `composer.json` to include classmap autoloading (similar to [pieceofcake2/app](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/app)):
  ```json
  {
    "autoload": {
      "classmap": ["src/"]
    }
  }
  ```

**For legacy projects (`app/` directory):**
- No action required - existing applications continue to work without changes
- The framework's `App::uses()` calls for application classes ensure backward compatibility

**Plugin classes:**
- Plugins that don't support Composer autoloading require `App::uses()` to load their classes (same as before):
  ```php
  App::uses('MyPluginHelper', 'MyPlugin.View/Helper');
  ```
- If a plugin's documentation indicates autoloading support, `App::uses()` may not be needed

**Custom Autoloader Override (optional):**
If you need to override autoloading behavior for specific classes, register your custom autoloader with the prepend flag to give it priority over Composer's autoloader:

   ```php
   // Example: Custom classmap-based autoloader
   $customClassMap = [
       'MyCustomClass' => '/path/to/MyCustomClass.php',
       'AnotherClass' => '/path/to/AnotherClass.php',
   ];

   spl_autoload_register(function($class) use ($customClassMap) {
       if (isset($customClassMap[$class])) {
           require $customClassMap[$class];
           return true;
       }
       return false;
   }, true, true); // throw=true, prepend=true (priority over Composer)
   ```

   **Parameters explained:**
   - First `true`: Throw exception if autoloader registration fails
   - Second `true`: Prepend to autoloader queue (gives priority over Composer's autoloader)

### Bake Plugin Extraction ([PR #17](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/17))

- **Bake functionality has been extracted to a separate plugin** ([pieceofcake2/bake](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/bake))
- `BakeShell` and all Bake tasks removed from core (`BakeTask`, `ModelTask`, `ControllerTask`, `ViewTask`, `FixtureTask`, `TestTask`, `TemplateTask`, `ProjectTask`, `PluginTask`, `DbConfigTask`, `CommandTask`)
- Application skeleton templates moved from `lib/Cake/Console/Templates/skel/` to Bake plugin
- Dispatcher files (`index.php`, `test.php`, `cake`) now located in Bake plugin
- Console bake commands no longer available without installing the Bake plugin

**Migration:**
1. Install the Bake plugin separately: `composer require --dev pieceofcake2/bake`
2. Load the plugin in your `app/Config/bootstrap.php`:
   ```php
   CakePlugin::load('Bake');
   ```
3. Copy dispatcher files from Bake plugin if needed (for new projects)

**Why this change:**
- Allows independent development and versioning of Bake functionality
- Reduces core framework size
- Most production applications don't need Bake in production

### Legacy Upgrade Plugin Extraction ([PR #19](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/19))

- **Legacy Upgrade functionality has been extracted to a separate plugin** ([pieceofcake2/upgrade](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/upgrade))
- `UpgradeShell` removed from core
- Legacy upgrade commands (1.3 → 2.0) no longer available without installing the Upgrade plugin

**Migration:**
> [!NOTE]
> The Upgrade plugin is only relevant for upgrading legacy CakePHP 1.3 applications to 2.0, which is extremely rare in 2025. Most users will never need this plugin.

If you need to upgrade a CakePHP 1.3 application to 2.0, install the Upgrade plugin separately:
```bash
composer require --dev pieceofcake2/upgrade
```

Then load the plugin in your `app/Config/bootstrap.php`:
```php
CakePlugin::load('Upgrade');
```

**Why this change:**
- Reduces core framework size
- The Upgrade plugin is only useful for upgrading from CakePHP 1.3 to 2.0
- Almost no one needs this functionality in 2025

### Composer-Only Installation Required ([PR #14](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/14))

- **Non-Composer installation is no longer supported**
- Dispatcher files (`app/webroot/index.php`, `app/webroot/test.php`, `app/Console/cake`) require Composer autoload
- Removed manual `CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH` detection from dispatcher files
- Removed `include_path` manipulation logic
- Removed legacy `app/Vendor/cakephp/cakephp` path detection
- Removed `app/Console/cake.bat` and `app/Console/cake.php` (Windows batch file and PHP wrapper no longer needed)

**Migration:**
1. Ensure you're using Composer for dependency management
2. Install the Bake plugin: `composer require --dev pieceofcake2/bake`
3. Copy updated dispatcher files from `plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/` to your application:
   ```bash
   cp plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/webroot/index.php app/webroot/index.php
   cp plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/webroot/test.php app/webroot/test.php
   cp plugins/Bake/Console/Templates/skel/Console/cake app/Console/cake
   ```
4. Remove old dispatcher files if present:
   ```bash
   rm -f app/Console/cake.bat app/Console/cake.php
   ```
5. Run `composer install` to ensure all dependencies are properly loaded

### Cache Engines Removed ([PR #4](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/4))

- **Xcache** support has been removed (not compatible with PHP 7.0+)
- **Wincache** support has been removed (not actively maintained for PHP 8.x)

**Migration:**
- If using these cache engines, migrate to Redis, Memcached, or APCu

### Database Driver Methods Added ([PR #3](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/3))

- New methods added to database drivers (may cause issues if you have custom driver implementations)

**MySQL Driver (Mysql.php):**
- `getVersion(): string` - Returns MySQL/MariaDB/Aurora MySQL version
- `getServerType(): string` - Returns 'MySQL', 'MariaDB', or 'Aurora MySQL'
- `utf8mb4Supported(): bool` - Checks utf8mb4 character set support
- `integerDisplayWidthDeprecated(): bool` - Checks if integer display width is deprecated (MySQL 8.0.17+)

**PostgreSQL Driver (Postgres.php):**
- `getVersion(): string` - Returns PostgreSQL version

**Migration:**
- If you have custom database drivers extending these classes, implement these methods

### Database Charset Configuration Changes ([PR #11](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/11))

- Character set configuration moved from `SET NAMES` to DSN connection options
- **MySQL**: Charset now in DSN (e.g., `mysql:...;charset=utf8`)
- **PostgreSQL**: Client encoding in DSN options (e.g., `pgsql:...;options='--client_encoding=UTF8'`)
- **PostgreSQL**: `sslmode` parameter is now optional in DSN

**Migration:**
- No action required - changes are backward compatible
- `setEncoding()` methods still work for runtime changes
- More efficient connection setup with charset in DSN

### SQL Server Driver Updates ([PR #9](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/9))

#### Configuration Format

- **Schema-based configuration**: Use schema mapping instead of multiple databases
  ```php
  // Old approach (still works)
  'database' => 'cakephp_test2'

  // New recommended approach
  'database' => 'cakephp_test',
  'schema' => [
      'default' => 'dbo',
      'test2' => 'test2',
      'test_database_three' => 'test3',
  ]
  ```

- **Connection options**: SSL/TLS options now in `options` array
  ```php
  'options' => [
      'TrustServerCertificate' => 'yes',
      'Encrypt' => 'no',
  ]
  ```

- **Port configuration**: Specify port separately (automatically appended to server)

#### Method Signature Changes

- `describe($model): array` - Now has explicit return type
- `insertMulti()` - Now returns `bool` instead of `void`

**Migration:**
- Update SQL Server configuration to use schema mapping (optional but recommended)
- Move SSL/TLS options to `options` array if using inline DSN
- If extending Sqlserver class, update method signatures to match

### Mail Function Updates ([PR #10](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/10))

- `MailTransport::_mail()` method signature changed with strict types
- Old: `protected function _mail($to, $subject, $message, $headers, $params = null)`
- New: `protected function _mail(string $to, string $subject, string $message, array|string $headers = [], string $params = ''): void`

**Migration:**
- No action required unless you've extended `MailTransport` class
- If extending, update method signature to match strict types

### CSRF Token Security Enhancement ([PR #5](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/5))

- New CSRF tokens use HMAC-SHA1 signatures (prevents CVE-2020-15400)
- Token format changed to base64-encoded (16-byte value + 20-byte HMAC)

**Migration:**
- **No action required** - automatic and backward compatible
- Existing tokens continue to work
- New tokens generated with enhanced security

### strftime() Replacement

- `strftime()` deprecated in PHP 8.1, removed in PHP 8.2
- Now uses `IntlDateFormatter` via Symfony's ICU Polyfill
- Fallback to `PHP81_BC\strftime` for compatibility

**Migration:**
- Most date formatting works identically
- Edge cases may produce slightly different output
- Test date formatting in your application

### Development Tools Updates

#### PHP CodeSniffer ([PR #8](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/8))

- Updated from 1.0.0 to 5.3
- Applied automatic formatting fixes

**Migration:**
- Development-time change only
- Update `phpcs.xml` if you have custom coding standards

#### PHPUnit Compatibility

- Framework tests migrated to PHPUnit 9.6
- All deprecated PHPUnit features fixed

**Migration:**
- Update your tests if using deprecated PHPUnit features

### PHP 8 Syntax Modernization ([PR #7](https://github.com/pieceofcake2/cakephp/pull/7))

- Codebase modernized to PHP 8 syntax

**Changes:**
- `array()` → `[]`
- `get_class()` → `::class`
- `list()` → `[]` for array destructuring
- `dirname(__FILE__)` → `__DIR__`
- Added null coalescing operators
- Native `str_contains()`, `str_starts_with()`, `str_ends_with()`

**Migration:**
- **No action required** - syntax changes only, no functionality changes

### CookieComponent 'cipher' Type - Insecure and Should Be Replaced

- The default `CookieComponent` encryption type `'cipher'` is horribly insecure

> [!WARNING]
> As stated in the CakePHP source code comments:
> > "Cipher is horribly insecure and only the default because of backwards compatibility. In new applications you should always change this to 'aes' or 'rijndael'."

**Why 'cipher' is insecure:**
- Uses `Security::cipher()` with XOR encryption (cryptographically weak)
- Uses `Security.cipherSeed` with undefined float-to-int casting behavior
- The seed value: `mt_srand((int)(float)Configure::read('Security.cipherSeed'))` has no guaranteed consistency
- Not suitable for protecting sensitive data

**Migration:**
```php
// OLD (insecure - DO NOT USE)
public $components = [
    'Cookie' => [
        'type' => 'cipher'  // Default, horribly insecure
    ]
];

// NEW (recommended)
public $components = [
    'Cookie' => [
        'type' => 'aes'  // or 'rijndael'
    ]
];

// Or dynamically in your controller
$this->Cookie->type('aes');
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changing encryption type will invalidate existing cookies. Plan your migration strategy accordingly (e.g., support both types during transition period).
